\section{Introduction}

\citet{greeley1991magma} produced one of the first extrusive magma flux estimates for the surface of Mars and used terrestrial intrusive/extrusive ratios to calculate that $6.5\cdot 10^8$ km$^3$ of magma has been generated on Mars in the past 3.8 Ga. For the most recent 500 Ma, magma production was observed to wane, and only $2.11\cdot 10^6$ km$^3$ of magma was modeled to have erupted \citep{greeley1991magma}. This global extrusive magma flux of 0.004 km$^3$/yr (0.13 m$^3$/s) remains one of few such estimates of magma production. Constraining past and recent magma production and extrusion rates, however, is of vital importance in understanding evolution of the Martian climate \citep[e.g.]{mouginis2008lava,halevy2014episodic}, lithosphere and mantle \citep{grott2013long}, surface \citep{wilson1994mars}, and the ability of Mars to sustain biotic or pre-biotic material over time \citep{scanlon2015volcanism}.

The large volcanic edifices of the Tharsis region have been given a time-averaged magma flux estimate of 0.05 m$^3$/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty, for an active construction period of 1 Gyr (again with a factor of 3 uncertainty) by \citet{wilson2001evidence}. \citet{wilson2001evidence} further constrained periodic flux under these volcanoes by assuming each of the many summit calderas was formed in association with one stable magma body at depth. By calculating the necessary flux to achieve the magma bodies that could form such calderas, \citet{wilson2001evidence} found that the magma delivery rate to the volcanoes had to persist at 1-10 m$^3$/s for hundreds of thousands to millions of years, followed by orders of magnitude longer periods of quiescence before new large magma bodies could be emplaced. For example, assuming a magma chamber size of 50,000 km$^3$ under the Arsia Mons caldera \citep{wilson2001evidence}, it would take a 10 m$^3$/s magma flux 140 kyr to fill the magma chamber, representing $\sim$3\% of Arsia's total volume in just 0.01\% of a 1 Gyr constructional period.

We seek to estimate both the recurrence rate of volcanism and the extrusive magma delivery rate for the most recent volcanic unit on Arsia Mons---a patchwork of lava flows and 29 associated volcanic vents within the volcano caldera. To constrain these values, absolute ages and associated age uncertainty of each flow have been modeled using the size-frequency distribution of observed craters, relative ages between flows have been determined using superposition relationships, and volumes have been modeled using Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data \citep{smith2003mars}. Crater-retention age models and stratigraphic relations are integrated in a Volcanic Event Recurrence Rate Model (VERRM) to better characterize event age uncertainty and estimate recurrence rate throughout the period of time during which these lavas were emplaced.

\section{Geologic Background of Arsia Mons}

Arsia Mons is a major shield volcano on Mars and a member of the Tharsis Montes (Figure \ref{fig_locatormap}). With a diameter of over 300 km and slopes of 5$^{\circ}$ \citep{plescia2004morphometric}, the surface of Arsia contains lava flows, which served as the primary construction material of the shield \citep{mouginis2008lava}, prodigious ash deposits \citep{mouginis2002prodigious}, and glacial deposits \citep{head2003cold} emplaced under both cold- and warm-based glacial conditions \citep{scanlon2015volcanism}. At the summit of Arsia is a single collapse caldera measuring $\sim$4000 km$^3$ in volume \citep{wilson2001evidence}. Within this 110 km wide caldera, a linear cluster of secondary shield volcanoes comprise one of the youngest geologic units in the Arsia region \citep{carr1977some,scott1995geologic}. No craters larger than 1 km exist within the caldera and several detailed crater retention studies with different image datasets have independently produced 130 Ma as a single age estimate of the entire caldera floor \citep{neukum2004recent,werner2009global,robbins2011volcanic}.

Through Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter images of the Tharsis region, \citet{crumpler1978structural} determined that of the three Tharsis Montes, Arsia Mons is the most structurally evolved shield volcano. This conclusion was backed up by \citet{bleacher2007tharsis} with extensive mapping using HRSC and THEMIS. \citet{bleacher2007tharsis} suggested that the northward trending structural complexity of the Tharsis Montes might indicate a migrating magma source along the axis of the three volcanoes, similar to a Tharsis plume model by \citet{mege1996plume}. If such a migrating magma source did exist, then magma production at Arsia would have waned, decreasing the amount of melt available for continued summit volcanism.

\label{fig_lavamap}
\end{figure}

On the flank of Arsia Mons, \citet{mouginis2008lava} identified $>$1000 layered units in a graben, which were interpreted to be lava flows. Using MOLA data, they were able to estimate the height of the graben wall, enabling the estimation of layer thicknesses between 10-80 m, with most being $>$30 m. As no unique and laterally extensive layers were observed in the stack of $<$2 km wide layers, \citet{mouginis2008lava} concluded that no major glacial events were emplaced between the deposition of these layers, perhaps indicating relatively rapid emplacement of 885 m of lava. By instead assuming constant activity of Arsia Mons for either 2 or 3 billion years, \citet{mouginis2008lava} estimated that the stack could have been emplaced over 290 or 435 million years, respectively. 

\subsection{Other recent volcanism in the Tharsis Region}

Outside of Arsia, several volcanic events and trends in the Amazonian Period ($<$3~Ga) have been identified. On Olympus Mons, the latest flank lava flows appear to have transitioned from long tube-fed flows to shorter, channel-fed flows, suggesting that magma flux per flow emplacement event waned over the late Amazonian \citep{bleacher2007olympus}. \citet{bleacher2007olympus} concluded that this might be evidence of a larger waning of activity at Olympus and might also signal a transition from a deep mantle source of volcanism to shallower sources, based on long-term volcanic patterns observed at the Hawaiian volcanic chain. These observations might be consistent with the \citet{wilson2001evidence} model that most of the history of these volcanoes is spent dormant after hyper-active edifice building episodes wane and end.

Recent volcanism elsewhere in Tharsis has occurred in a more distributed fashion \citep{hauber2011very}, including a lava field filling the southeast ``moat'' of Olympus Mons \citep{chadwick2015late}. \citet{chadwick2015late} identified lava flows at the base of Olympus emplaced between 64-210 Ma, similar in time to previous age estimates of the study area in this paper ($\sim$130~Ma). The emplacement direction of these lavas are systematically offset from the current downward direction, due to recent subsidence of Olympus Mons. This might provide evidence contrart to he findings of \citet{bleacher2007olympus}, as \citet{chadwick2015late} estimate that the magma required to be injected into Olympus Mons the past 200 Myr in order to cause this subsidence might be 10$^5$-10$^6$ km$^3$. This would suggest that Olympus is not yet extinct.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Unit and stratigraphic mapping}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/stratigraphy_web.png}
\caption{Stratigraphic relationships within the Arsia Mons Caldera. Higher flows (e.g. v00) are higher stratigraphically.

Age estimates from craterstats2 are given in superscript; * symbols indicate no age was estimated due to a lack of craters with D$\ge$100~m.}
\label{fig_stratweb}
\end{figure}

The 29 mapped volcanic vents within the caldera each have lava flows emanating from them that form positive topographic features over the surrounding terrain. Flows corresponding to each vent have been mapped in ArcGIS 10.2 with georeferenced Context Imager (CTX) photographs \citep{malin2007context} serving as a 6-m resolution basemap (Figure \ref{fig_lavamap}). Flows are mapped in association with an observed vent where flows can be unambiguously traced directly back to the vent using flow features. Some lava flows on the eastern and western margins of the caldera appear to flow away from the caldera center and might have been created during an event that formed any of the observed vents; however, because they are covered in subsequent flows and are separated from their parent vent by at least one flow front, they cannot be traced to a vent and are not included in our catalog.

Mapped flows which abut each other have an inherent superposition relationship. Using available CTX images, these relationships are documented for all neighboring flows by identifying features such as 1) diverted flows around pre-existing topography, 2) infilling of graben or volcanic vents, and 3) continuous flow features suddenly vanishing under overlying flows. Superposition relationships are graphed according to stratigraphic height in Figure \ref{fig_stratweb}.

\subsection{Crater retention age modeling}

Mapped units within the caldera (29 lava flow units and 1 ``undifferentiated lavas'' unit) have been assigned model ages based on the distribution of impact craters within their boundaries. \citet{robbins2011volcanic} previously found that, in the Arsia Mons caldera, crater frequency decreases for craters with diameters (D) of $\le$ 93~m, due to dust cover. \citet{robbins2011volcanic} also hypothesized that a background population of secondary craters in this area might contaminate the crater distribution at D $<$ 130 m. We have counted all craters in the caldera with D $\ge$ 100 m to avoid both of these systematic biases. Four lava flows have an exposed area smaller than 15 km$^2$ and an insignificant number of craters larger than 100~m were found on their surfaces (10 or fewer), so no crater age date was determined. The diameter and location of craters were mapped in ArcGIS~10.2 using a basemap of CTX images.

Modeled ages based on a impact production function, which is a model of the relative production rate of different impact crater sizes, and a chronology function, which models the change of impact frequency with time. Ages were modeled in the Craterstats2 software \citep{michael2013planetary}. For each mapped unit, craters are separated by diameter into bins of minimum diameter $2d$~km where $d$ increments by 0.5 between each bin, following the Hartmann 2004 iteration Production Function \citep{hartmann2005martian}. Ages are modeled based on this Production Function and the \citet{michael2013planetary} Chronology Function. Uncertainty of crater frequency in each bin is defined as $\sqrt{N}/S$, where $N$ is the number of craters and $S$ is the area of the mapped unit. The cumulative crater-size frequency distribution (and associated uncertainty) is assembled from each $2d$ km bin and is used to model a best fit age (see Figure \ref{fig_craterct}. Ages and uncertainties for each mapped unit are reported in Ma.

For the four small flows where craters at D$>$30~m have been counted, the crater frequency roll-off is observed to occur between 35 and 60~m. To model the ages of these flows, only craters larger than this roll-off diameter are included. If a background population of secondary craters $\ge$130~m is present, the  cumulative crater-size frequency distribution should have an increased slope below this diameter. This slope increase was not visually seen in individual mapped units, though if it is present then the four small flows will have modeled ages that are older than the actual flow age. 

\subsection{Volume estimation}\label{sec_volume}
%Volume

%The thicknesses of the mapped flows are unknown, which makes estimating flow volume a challenge. Thicknesses of lava flows on the flanks of Arsia Mons have been measured to be several to tens of meters (Moug.). If this range is taken to be upper and lower thickness bounds for each lava flow, a volume range can be calculated for each flow by multiplying these bounds by the exposed area.

%An alternative volume estimation method would be to (TIN)


%As each event in the catalog has a modeled volume, the volume flux through time can be estimated for each MC result. Th


Two volume estimation methods are used to provide minimum and maximum volume constraints for each lava flow (Figure \ref{fig_crosssection}). A primary initial assumption of these methods is that the erupted material was predominantly effusive, while insignificant material would have been advected far from the source.

First, volumes are estimated for each individual flow. Elevation values are assigned to the mapped perimeter of each flow from the gridded-MOLA topographic dataset. The subsurface of the flow is modeled with a triangular irregular network (TIN) where mesh faces are generated with the Delaunay triangulation of vertices along the perimeter. The modeled subsurface is then subtracted from the MOLA grid, producing a thickness map which is integrated to estimate flow volume. This estimate should be considered to be a minimum estimate of flow volume, because the modeled sub-flow surface tightly connects the lava flow margins, while in real life lava flows invert topography and should likely have a deeper, more concave upward subsurface. Though these volumes are underestimates, their advantage is that they are carried out for each flow.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figures/volumehist.png}
\caption{Minimum estimated volumes of each lava flow using an interpolated mesh as a theoretical subsurface. All lavas are estimated to be between 10$^{-3}$-1~km$^3$, with most volumes centering around 1~km$^3$.}
\label{fig_volumehistogram}
\end{figure}

Second, volume is estimated for the entire caldera using a convex hull of the MOLA topography. The topographic convex hull includes the lowest points in and along the perimeter of the caldera. Points in the hull are again used to model a subsurface using a Delaunay-generated TIN and the volume of the caldera lavas are estimated by subtracting this subsurface from the MOLA topography. Unlike the previous method, this volume cannot easily be divided amongst the mapped flows, might include buried events, and does include distal flows that are not included in the catalog but might correspond to mapped vents. Because of these potential biases, the resulting volume is likely a maximum estimate and does not provide volume estimates for individual events. The estimated caldera volume is therefore divided equally between the 29 mapped vents to provide a maximum estimate.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Volcanic Event Recurrence Rate Model (VERRM)}

Together, stratigraphic information and crater retention age estimates can be consolidated to improve age uncertainty estimation for volcanic events. This is especially applicable to recent volcanic landforms on Mars as crater-based dates alone might be biased due to crater burial, local topography, or secondary crater background populations \citep{robbins2011volcanic,platz2011eruption}.

To accomplish the task of constraining modeled age estimates with stratigraphy, and ultimately to describe the repose interval of volcanic events in the region, we have devised an algorithm, which we call the Volcanic Event Recurrence Rate Model (VERRM). VERRM implements a Monte Carlo algorithm that assigns a potential age to each volcanic event by defining an event age distribution function, $A$, with an event's modeled crater retention rate age and age uncertainty, as reported by Craterstats2. The age distribution function for each event is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, which is a suitable for the events in this study as they are relatively recent and the crater impact rate during the time of their emplacement is thought to be constant \citep{vaucher2009volcanic}. The initial age function is given as $A_i(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$ where $\mu$ is the estimated age determined by crater retention and σ is the uncertainty of the estimated age of cataloged event i. VERRM then constrains A with a binary stratigraphy function, with possible ages having a value of 1 and ages outside an acceptable age range having a value of 0. Possible ages are defined by previously dated events in the VERRM simulation; stratigraphically higher events connected to the event at hand give a minimum age of the stratigraphy function, while lower events give a maximum age. If no stratigraphically-related events have been dated, the minimum age bound is set to the present, and the maximum age bound is set to three times older than the oldest crater retention rate modeled age in this field (330 Ma), or 1 Ga.

The normalized product of the the Gaussian age function and the binary stratigraphy function gives an age distribution function which does not violate stratigraphy but is informed by crater retention age estimates. This function is sampled to date an event and the process repeats for the next event. By repeating this process 10,000 times, the potential age ranges for each event is determined.

Volcanic recurrence rate RR at any time $t$ is modeled for each MC solution as
\begin{equation}
\text{RR}(t) = \frac{n-1}{\text{max}\{\mathbf{T}\} - \text{min}\{\mathbf{T}\}}
\label{eq_RR}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is an even number and $\mathbf{T}$ is the set of ages of $n$ events temporally surrounding $t$. Events whose ages are elements of set $\mathbf{T}$ are identified as the closest $n/2$ events either before or after $t$. The even number $n$ is essentially a local window in time, and $n-1$ is the number of recurring events between $\text{max}\{\mathbf{T}\}-\text{min}\{\mathbf{T}\}$ after the earliest event occurrence. Note that all times $t$ laying between two temporally consecutive events will have the same set $\mathbf{T}$ and will therefore have the same calculated recurrence rate.

The set $\mathbf{T}$ is also modified for early and late times in the MC solution. For times before the earliest event in an individual simulation (i.e. where $t$ is greater than the time of the oldest age assigned to an event), $\mathbf{T}$ includes the earliest $n-1$ events and time $t$. When $t$ falls in time between the earliest event and the $n/2^{\text{th}}$ event to occur in the simulation, $\mathbf{T}$ includes the first $n$ events. Likewise, for later (i.e. more recent) times, where $t$ is more recent than the earliest event, $\mathbf{T}$ includes both $t$ and the most recent $n-1$ events. Where $t$ falls in time between the most recent event and the $n/2^{\text{th}}$ most recent event, $\mathbf{T}$ is the set of the most recent $n$ events. For the cases where $t$ is at the same time as the earliest or latest events, $\mathbf{T}$ will be the set of times of the $n$ earliest or latest events, respectively.

While recurrence rate for any one MC simulation might be bad, the range of recurrence rates for all simulations can provide a confidence envelope of recurrence rate with respect to time. The recurrence rate for the field is defined as the median recurrence rate of all simulations over time, with a 95\% confidence envelope serving as the rate's uncertainty.

Volume flux is also modeled with the VERRM output. Each event is assigned a volume between the minimum and maximum volume estimates (discussed above in section \ref{sec_volume}) for the lava flow it produced. Volume flux for the field is defined similarly using a 95\% confidence envelope and median value of the volume of erupted lava per million year time bin.

\section{Results}

\caption{Minimum estimated flow volumes compared to stratigraphic level (See Figure \ref{fig_stratweb}). The y-axis counts the number of indirectly overlaying flows. While flow volume increases with fewer overlapping lava flows, large volumes have been estimated for stratigraphically lower flows.}
\label{fig_volumeandstrat}
\end{figure}

The 29 lava flows in our catalog are mapped to cover 6700 km$^2$, $\sim$70\%, of the caldera, representing the majority of surface lavas within the caldera walls (Figure \ref{fig_lavamap}). Individual lava flow volume estimates range from $1.6\cdot 10^{-3}$ to 5 km$^3$, with an average of 1.1 km$^3$ per flow (Figure \ref{fig_volumehistogram}). Buried flows are, on average, smaller in volume, but not all stratigraphically lower flows are small in volume (Figure \ref{fig_volumeandstrat}). The total volume using the individual volume estimations, again assumed to be a minimum, is 31 km$^3$. The total volume using the convex hull approach over the entire caldera is 400 km$^3$. This estimate is more than an order of magnitude larger than the minimum volume estimate and would mean each vent expelled roughly 13 km$^3$ of lava. Results for each lava flow are recorded in Table (\ref{tab_database}).

Dividing the total minimum volume estimate by the mapped flow coverage area, and the total maximum volume by the entire caldera floor area (9500 km$^2$), average flow thickness is calculated to be 8.5 and 40~m, respectively. These averages are in agreement with other studies of lava flow thickness, including flows  in Elysium Mons with thicknesses of 7-35 m \citep{pasckert2012rheologies}, flows on Ascreaus Mons between 24-88 m \citep{hiesinger2007young}, 37 m and 50 m thick flows in the Elysium region and on Pavonis Mons \citep{glaze2003methodology,baloga2003rheology}, and average flow thicknesses on the Arsia Mons flanks of 10-30 m \citep{mouginis2008lava}.

Event ages modeled with craters on each lava flow lay between 70 and 300~Ma. However, the oldest modeled ages do not appear at the bottom of the stratigraphic column, and the youngest modeled ages do not appear at the top (Figure \ref{fig_stratweb}). This can either be due to error in identifying superposition relationships or due to bias in the crater population. By relying on stratigraphy more than crater counts, which are known to be unreliable at small diameters \citep[e.g.]{robbins2011volcanic,neukum2004recent}, the VERRM model can probabilistically improve the estimated timing of events, while also better characterizing age uncertainty through a Monte Carlo method.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Comparisons to other studies}

Modeled ages of these flows with our crater counts lay between 70-400 Ma, with uncertainties reported by craterstats2 to be between 10-100 Myr. Our ages confirm modeled ages produced by other authors, where we find the crater-derived model age of the entire caldera to be 130 Ma, similar to  \citet{neukum2004recent}, \citet{werner2009global} and \citep{robbins2011volcanic}. \citet{robbins2011volcanic} also used crater retention rates (for D≥93 m) to date a single endogenous crater located within the caldera at 9.70°S, 239.18°E as having an age of 97$\pm$49 Ma. We independently date the lava flow associated with this vent to have an age of 99$\pm$15 Ma (Figure \ref{fig_craterct}).

\caption{Cumulative crater frequency distributions for (left) one lava flow, (center) all mapped lava flows, (right) the entire caldera). The example flow, v03 in our database, had been previously estimated to be 97$\pm$49 Ma from crater counting performed on a HiRISE image \citep{robbins2011volcanic}. Our age of 99$\pm$15 Ma agrees with this previous finding. The age of the entire caldera also generally agrees with previous estimates of 130~Ma. The mapped vents plot younger than the entire caldera, which is expected as they are the most recent resurfacing events on the caldera.}

Our initial VERRM results suggest that the Arsia field might have been active for 230 Myr, ending about 70 Mya. If 280 km$^3$ of basalt was emplaced as lavas during this time, the time-averaged volume flux of the field would have been 1,200 m$^3$ a$^{-1}$.($3.6\cdot 10^{-4}$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$). This is two orders of magnitude less active than the magma flux estimated for Central Elysium Planitia, calculated by \citet{vaucher2009volcanic} to be $1.4\cdot 10^{-2}$ to $1.8\cdot 10^{-2}$ m$^3$/s over the most recent 234 Myr, through similar volume estimates of lava flows and a crater retention rate study. Our estimate is also 5 orders of magnitude lower than the average magma flux (30 m$^3$ s$^{-1}$) \citet{wilson2001evidence} calculated would be needed to charge the most recent magma chamber under Arsia Mons. If we employ the same 8.5:1 intrusive/extrusive ratio used by \citet{greeley1991magma}, the total magma production at depth during the emplacement of the caldera flows would be $3.4\cdot 10^{-3}$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$). This is still much lower than the estimated flux necessary to sustain a magma chamber, but is only one order of magnitude smaller than the average flux needed to build Arsia Mons in 1 Gyr, 0.05 m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ \citep{wilson2001evidence}.

Time-averaged recurrence can be estimated by dividing the total elapsed time of volcanic activity by number of events. For instance, \citet{richardson2013volcanic} identified 263 monogenetic volcanic vents within Syria Planum, which were interpreted to be emplaced from 3.6-2.9 Ga, or 700 Myr. If volcanism were constant in that area, a new volcanic vent would have been formed every 2.7 Myr. In a graben on the northwest flank of Arsia, \citet{mouginis2008lava} mapped $>$1000 lava flows and estimated construction rates of 290 and 435 million years, based on the time to build all of Arsia Mons. This would correspond to a recurrence of at least one episode of lava emplacement every 290 or 440 kyr. A time-averaged recurrence for our 29 vents, created over 230 Myr, would be one event every 8 Myr. This alone would imply that the latest volcanic activity on Arsia Mons was much closer in style to the volcanism on Syria Planum than during the main constructional phases of Arsia Mons.

\subsection{Effects on tropical mountain glaciers on Arsia Mons}

In the past decade, studies have interpreted fan-shaped deposits on the western flanks of the Tharsis Montes to be recent glacial deposits, due to the presence of fresh moraines and possible stranded ice blocks, analogous to kettles on Earth \citep{shean2007recent,kadish2014middle,scanlon2015remnant}. The material on these broad deposits have been dated by \citet{kadish2014middle} to have been emplaced around 200 Ma. \citet{scanlon2015volcanism} identified fan-shaped deposits on the western flank of Arsia Mons which contain evidence of basal melting in clear association with sub-glacial volcanic eruptions. 

Recent analysis of smooth facies deposits to the northwest of the Arsia summit has provided evidence that tropical mountain glaciers are, in fact, extant and covered in ash \citep{scanlon2015remnant}. The penetration depth of viscously relaxed ring-mold craters on these deposits indicates a maximum material blanket thickness of less than 230 m over tens to hundreds of meters of ice or ice-rich material \citep{head2014preservation}. A large portion of this insulating material might in fact be volcanic ash \citep{wilson1994mars,mouginis2002prodigious}.

The presence of volcanic ash on remaining tropical mountain glaciers on the flank of Arsia might be a result of the most recent volcanism in the Arsia caldera. If this is the case, our volume estimates would likely be severely underestimated, as a large portion of erupted material would have been transported away from the vent as tephra. However, as \citet{kadish2014middle} estimated the resurfacing age of the fan-shaped deposits to be about 200 Ma, roughly our interpreted age of onset of effusive activity within the caldera, it is possible that the ash on the flanks and the lavas in the caldera represent a transition from explosive to effusive volcanism at Arsia Mons. The provenance of the ash might be buried by the recent lavas or might be the ``parasitic calderas'' observed by \citet{crumpler1996calderas}, which form a rift of the south and north caldera walls of Arsia, in line with the shield volcanoes in our catalog.

\subsection{Transition of volcanic style and waning of Arsia volcanism}
From our findings and evidence of prodigious amounts of ash to the west \citep{mouginis2002prodigious}, we interpret the intra-caldera lava flows to represent the waning of activity at Arsia Mons, which effectively ended $\sim$70~million years ago. Preceding the formation of the large basaltic caldera, magmatic activity would have mainly been related to a large magma chamber, which was active at a heightened rate \citep{wilson2001evidence}. Dikes ascending below this chamber are expected to propagate towards the chamber and ultimately assimilate with it \citep{karlstrom2009organization}, effectively suppressing monogenetic volcanism directly above the chamber during its molten history. Instead, large events related to the central chamber would have occurred, perhaps supplying the provenance of ash now mantling ice-rich material on Arsia's west flanks.

The relatively small volumes and distributed nature of the lavas within the caldera, as well as the caldera itself, are evidence that the magma chamber has cooled and that dikes are able to ascend individually through the center of the caldera. The magma supply rate to the base of Arsia must therefore have waned to below $\sim$12~m$^3$~s$-1$ (plus or minus a factor of three) \citep{wilson2001evidence}. The long-term average surface flux of distributed volcanism in this study, $3.6\cdot 10^{-4}$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$, is five orders of magnitude below this minimum supply rate.

The confidence envelope for volcanic recurrence rate for times older than the peak of volcanism in this study (XXX~Ma) is largely unconstrained; while the envelope suggests that recurrence among the 29 volcanoes waxes during this time, it cannot be used to imply that volcanic activity in general waxed during this time. It is beyond likely that below the 29 lava flows, other flows and volcanic vents are buried. The waxing trend seen in our results might be erroneous because of a lack of data on buried events. However, it is likely that the waning trend observed since XXX~Ma is real.

\section{Conclusions}

The 29 lava flows mapped in the caldera create a volcanic field that was active since at least 230~Ma and became inactive at around 70~Ma. These flows represent 30-400~km$^3$, giving a surfacial magma flux rate of $3.6\cdot 10^{-4}$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$, averaged over the entire history of the 29 events.

Our main conclusion is that the recurrence rate of intra-caldera volcanism on Arsia Mons has waned since XXX~Ma and that this waning, as well as the presence of distributed lava flows in the caldera alone, represent the tail-end of an episode of activity in Arsia Mons that formed the large basaltic caldera and a corresponding magma chamber hypothesized by \citet{wilson2001evidence}.
