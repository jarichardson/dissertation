  Abstract                 = {NCALM Seed. PI: Jacob Richardson, University of South Florida. The survey area is a rectangular polygon located 85 km southwest of Green River, Utah in the San Rafael region of the state. The polygon is approximately 4.5 km wide by 8.3 km long and encloses 54 square km. The data were collected to look at exposed subsurface volcanic features in San Rafael, Utah. The survey took place on August 14, 2013.},
