Spatial density can tell us about the depth of the magma source and/or the conductivity of the crust between the magma source and the surface. It also is dependent on the productivity of the magma source or, to be more exact, how many volcanoes are produced. Possibly this can be normalized (or made more complicated instead) by factoring in volume.

Fundamental questions:
1) What are the differences in spatial density on different planets and in different tectonic regions
2) What are the diffences in volume flux density on different planets and "   "   "

Interpretive questions:
1) Can these differences tell us about the source depth?
2) Can these differences tell us about lithospheric differences?
3) Can these differences tell us about source productivity?
4) If not any of these, what accounts for the differences in spatial density?
	a) water? magma chemistry? gravity?

Clusters of tens to thousands of monogenetic volcanoes are present on Earth, Venus, and Mars. In this investigation, volcano clusters from Venus and Mars are analyzed and compared to monogenetic volcanic fields on Earth. Spatial intensity (vents/sq km) of volcano clusters is calculated using nonparametric kernel methods and an optimized elliptical bandwidth uniquely defined for each cluster. This objective data-driven technique allows for comparison between volcanic fields in different regions and on different planets.

Mars: Monogenetic volcanism on Mars occurs as fields of distributed low shields with diameters of tens of kilometers and heights of tens to hundreds of meters. These shield fields are recently recognized to be a major component of Tharsis Province volcanism as the province contains several hundreds of low shields. A Tharsis-wide data set of volcanic vents has been prepared using gridded topographic data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and images from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), the Context Imager (CTX), and the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). Topographic rises of >10s meters with visible apex craters and/or radial flows were cataloged as vents;  topographic rises without apparent apex craters or flows were cataloged as likely vents. In this investigation, the spatial intensities of two shield fields within the Tharsis data set are determined by nonparametric kernel methods. The area within each two-sigma kernel bandwidth is calculated to be 2440 and 4330 square kilometers, respectively.

Venus: Monogenetic volcanism on Venus occurs on two apparent scales, as shield fields (hundreds of vents) covering thousands to tens of thousands of square kilometers and as broader shield plains (thousands of vents) which individually cover thousands to millions of square kilometers. Volcanoes within these clusters are identified as 1-10 km in diameter with low (1-5 degree) slopes. Four shield fields and three shield plains have been cataloged using Magellan left-look radar data. Radar-bright or dark circular features with central craters and/or flows were cataloged as vents and those without craters or flows were cataloged as likely vents. These shield fields and plains are defined by two-sigma kernel bandwidths of 127-282 sq km for shield fields and 2740-3250 sq km for shield plains. This result suggests that spatial intensity of shield volcano clusters on Venus might be bimodal; shield fields are significantly more dense than shield plains.

Comparison: Using the same nonparametric kernel method and bandwidth optimization procedure for monogenetic volcano clusters on Earth has produced kernel bandwidths with two-sigma areas of about 10-150 sq. km. Less dense terrestrial volcanic fields, such as the Yucca Mountain Region, NV, are similarly dense to Venusian shield fields. An order of magnitude less dense than these clusters, Venusian shield plains and Martian low-shield fields both have similar densities. The spatial intensity of volcanism within multiple volcanic fields on Earth, Venus, and Mars is compared using the the area of summed kernel bandwidths out to the 95th percentile contour for each cluster.

1.3.3   Task 3: Statistical Modeling of Volcano Clusters
We hypothesize that the distribution of vents, the discrete points at which magma intersected the surface of Mars, within a volcanic field is well described by a probability density function (PDF). This PDF is the likelihood of magma erupting at the surface and forming vents at a given location within the field. The shape of this PDF can be estimated from the mapped vent locations and is governed by the location and flux of a regional magma source and crustal constraints, such as durable subsurface units and pre-existing cracks. Why is it important to think of the vent distribution within a volcanic field on Mars as a PDF? First, despite our best efforts, the record on distributed volcanism on Mars is poorly constrianed. It is conceivable, of course, that some volcanic vents are missing from the catalog, while some features categorized as volcanic vents may have other origins. For example, lava tube collapse features or rootless vents can be mistaken for vents fed directly by magma bodies that ascended through the crust to the eruption point. Furthermore, lava flows from relatively young vents bury older vents and their products. Describing a vent distribution as a PDF emphasizes that clusters (modes) and volcanic field boundaries (tails of the distribution) are known with some uncertainty. Second, PDFs are continuous and differentiable. This makes it possible to systematically compare the areas of different volcanic fields, the intensity of volcanism within individual fields, volcanic field shapes and related features. Third, although volcanoes are thought of as discrete features at the surface, a point process, the geophysical processes that led to their formation are not so discrete. The magma source region may be characterized as a broad zone within which mantle is more susceptible to partial melting due to pressure, temperature, and/or compositional variations. On Earth, eroded volcanic fields show that dikes that reached the shallow subsurface are much more numerous than the vents themselves (Kiyosugi et al., 2012). Thus, it is appropriate to think of the volcanic field in terms of a continuous distribution, rather than in terms of the points (vent locations) alone. That is, the mapped vents at the surface are essentially a random sample of magma generation and transport events.
Therefore, a major activity of the proposed work is to analyze the distribution of Tharsis volcanoes by estimating PDFs from mapped vent distribution.  This is now practical because powerful methods have been developed to estimate PDFs from point processes using nonparametric methods that avoid a priori assumptions about the distribution. Specifically, the likelihood of a vent at a given location can be estimated nonparametrically using kernel density estimation (KDE). This density estimation method resolves a bivariate Normal density function, or a density function that is a combination of Normal density functions, using a random sample from the function. With a sufficient count of points, the density estimate will asymptotically approach the ``true" PDF (Silverman, 1986; Duong and Hazelton, 2003). KDE has been previously used to estimate volcanic risk on Nuclear Facilities (Connor and Connor, 2009). In this proposed work, we plan to explore Kernel Density Estimation as a means to objectively quantify distribution and variation in Tharsis volcanic fields.
In detail, KDE is a nonparametric statistical method to find PDFs from point processes. The main assumption in the method is that a kernel function can be associated with each mapped vent (e.g., Figure 5). Integrating the kernel function across the entire volcanic field creates a PDF, which depends on the distribution of vents and the shape of the kernel function. Analysis focuses on estimating the appropriate shape of the kernel function, using both optimization algorithms relying on the vent distribution and geologic data. For example, the Gaussian kernel function to calculate the estimated spatial density for a given location s, , λˆ (s), is:

(1)
where |H| is the determinant of a 2×2 covariance matrix, H, b = H−1/2d and bT is the transform of b. d is a 1 × 2 distance matrix to each individual  vent and N is the number of vent locations (Wand and Jones, 1995). The covariance matrix,  H, is also referred  to as a smoothing parameter or bandwidth and its value determines the amount of smoothing exhibited by the Gaussian probability density function at each vent. This bandwidth covariance matrix can be optimized to approximate the unknown likelihood of eruption at a given location PDF described previously.  This optimization is accomplished through the Smoothed Asymptotic Mean Integrated Squared Error (SAMSE) method (Duong and Hazelton, 2003), freely available in the statistical package R (Duong, 2007).
A clear advantage of estimating the kernel function for a volcanic field using the SAMSE optimization algorithm is that it is completely objective. Since the kernel function is a characteristic property of any given volcano cluster, multiple clusters can be compared by comparing their bandwidths. Using the Gaussian kernel function example, the kernel bandwidth is a 2 x 2 covariance matrix which must be positive and definite. This bandwidth matrix may be visualized as an ellipse with an area that defines how “spread out” vent density is, and a directionality that accounts for development of alignments and related anisotropy in vent distribution. Both of these characteristics are important in describing a volcano cluster. The elongation of the bandwidth might indicate deviatoric stress of the crust, the elongation of melt source region, or the amount of migration of volcanism through time. The size of the enclosed area is proportional to the overall vent density of the cluster: a bandwidth with a small area describes a more dense cluster with a small spatial standard deviation, while a large bandwidth area describes a dispersed cluster with more area per vent.
By integrating Gaussian probability distributions at each cataloged vent in a volcano cluster (Equation (1)), the spatial density of the cluster can be estimated for any given location. This continuous, nonparametric density map indicates where, in space, volcanism has been most productive for the cluster.
Defining the boundary of a volcanic field has often proven problematic, even where field work is possible on Earth. One method to define these boundaries is to draw a “convex hull'” around the cluster. This method seeks to use the vent distribution to define the boundaries of the distribution, but is limited by two factors: 1) if the distribution is largely concave at any point, the ventless area in between vent-rich areas will be included and 2) the area immediately outside the vertex-defining vents is considered to be not part of the volcanic field, even as the vents' edifices extend outside of the field boundary. Another method often used to draw volcanic field boundaries is to use surfacial geologic boundaries, such as the extent of lava flows, but this method is also hindered by long effusive flows, especially on Mars where flows may be hundreds of km away from the vent field.
Instead of defining vent field areas through feature mapping alone, where the lava flow morphology and shape of the field might heavily bias a field's size, KDE may be employed as a statistical method of outlining a field (Connor et al., 2012, as a terrestrial example). We plan to experiment with determining the areas of volcanic fields using the KDE method. For example, we can define field area from the PDF as being the area enclosed by the 95% density contour. This allows the relative vent intensities per unit area to define the field on their own. We plan to test the sensitivity of this approach by estimating field areas using multiple kernel functions and thresholds (e.g., 95%, 99% density contours). This approach should provide an objective solution to the problem and allow us to compare different vent fields on Mars and other planets.
We plan to extend the data analysis of Tharsis vent distribution by modifying the KDE method to allow the bandwidth to vary on local scales within clusters. This analysis should provide new insights into variation in vent density, development of alignments, and changes in vent distribution as a function of time, where temporal data are sufficiently resolved. One way to estimate “local” bandwidth is to estimate the size and shape of the kernel function using a limited number of nearest-neighbor vents. For example, Figure 6 is a map of Tharsis Montes region immediately north of Noctis Labyrinthus, created using the SAMSE algorithm to find the best-fit bandwidth using only 10 nearest-neighbor vents. The best-fit kernel bandwidth changes across the map based on the local distribution and density of vents. Changes in vent density and directionality are prevalent on this map and reflect major geologic features. Vent density is high and bandwidths are relatively isotropic on the major rift aprons, except proximal to central calderas where the bandwidths are relatively anisotropic aligning parallel to NE-trend of the Tharsis Montes. In contrast, on the plains east of Pavonis, vent density is low and bandwidths emphasize the arcuate nature of the vent distribution. The point being that obvious changes on the map (the high density (darker) rift apron volcanism and low density (lighter) plains volcanism) reflect that different groups of distributed volcanoes are formed by different processes. By using this statistical approach (different numbers of nearest-neighbors, different bandwidth optimization algorithms), we can explore this structure in the vent distribution data and relate the findings to geological data from mapping and to temporal information from crater age-dating. This activity, of course, relies on Tasks 1 and 2 results and will be extended to include all of Tharsis. 
Proof of Concept Using the Tharsis Vent Catalog, spatial density estimates have been produced for two known clusters, Syria Planum and Southern Pavonis Mons. They have been mapped by normalized density in Figure 7 which was first reported by Richardson et al. (2012). The bandwidths produced by the SAMSE optimization method have been plotted as ellipses to the 95th percentile and have subsequently been compared to bandwidths corresponding to monogenetic volcanic fields on Earth and shield plains (Kiyosugi et al., 2012) and fields on Venus (Miller, 2012) (Figure 8).
The vent field areas were calculated taking the 95% density contour, i.e. where 95% of the density is within the enclosed space, as a statistical boundary of the cluster. For Syria Planum, the area within this contour is 325,000 km2 with an overall vent intensity of 8.00 × 10−4 vents per km2. In other words, on average there exists in Syria Planum one volcanic vent per every 1250 km2. Within the 64th percentile contour, this area decreases to one vent in every 636 km2 as the intensity nearly doubles to 1.57 × 10−3 vents per km2. The area of the Southern Pavonis Mons field is calculated in the same method to be 117,900 km2 with an overall vent intensity of 7.54 × 10−4 vents per km2 (one volcanic vent per every 1320 km2).
In summary, our work will estimate the vent spatial density of distributed volcanic fields which are defined from the Tharsis vent catalog through geologic mapping in Task 1. This will allow a direct comparison between vent fields throughout Tharsis. The variability of vent clustering on Tharsis can further be directly compared to clusters on other planets, expanding on Figure 6. Density maps will be drawn with the units of vents per unit area. Volume intensity maps of each cluster will be created by weighting each vent location by its estimated volume, achieved in Task 2a, thus showing spatial variation in eruptive productivity. By adding temporal estimates from Task 2b, we can create volume-flux maps, emphasizing the evolution of eruptive history through each cluster. We will perform these tasks for each volcanic field defined by Task 1. 


### EGU 2014
Earth, Venus and Mars clusters are compared using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) (e.g. Connor et al.,  J. App. Volc., 2012), which objectively compares cluster area, complexity, and vent density per sq. km. We show that Martian clusters are less dense than Venus clusters, which in turn are less dense than those on Earth. KDE and previous models of intrusive morphology for Mars and Venus are here used to calibrate the San Rafael plumbing system model to clusters on the two planets. The results from the calibrated Mars and Venus plumbing system models can be compared to previous estimates of magma budget and intrusive/extrusive ratios on Venus and Mars (e.g. Lillis et al, J. Volc. Geo. Res., 2009).
