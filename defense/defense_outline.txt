Distributed volcanism occurs given a diffuse magma source region from which
lava ascends as dikes and is sometimes emplaced as (SILLS). After this,
eruptions occur, sometimes producing (LAVA FLOWS). The long term evolution
of the field can be explored with (SPATIAL DENSITY). Very diffuse fields are
found on Mars, for example (SYRIA PLANUM). Another location is (ARSIA)
