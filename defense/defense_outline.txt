Distributed volcanism occurs given a diffuse magma source region from which
lava ascends as dikes and is sometimes emplaced as (SILLS). After this,
eruptions occur, sometimes producing (LAVA FLOWS). The long term evolution
of the field can be explored with (SPATIAL DENSITY). Very diffuse fields are
found on Mars, for example (SYRIA PLANUM). Another location is (ARSIA)

Intro
Distributed-style volcanism:
-Isolated dikes ascend individually
-Single eruptions at each location
-Long periods of quiescence

-Clusters of volcanoes are formed

Outline
Overview of Dissertation
-Sills
-Lava Flows
-Spatial Organization of Volcanoes
-A volcanic field on Mars (Syria)
Arsia Mons

Sills
Combined lidar datasets enable precise measurements of intrusive suite (dikes, sills)

90\% of igneous rock is stored in sills
Sill volume comparable to volume though to have erupted at surface

Lava Flows
-MOLASSES developed after Connor et al. 2012
-Spreads lava over a grid according to universal rules

-Using TanDEM-X satellite data, flow simulations match the 2012-3 Tolbachik flow between 70-85\%

Spatial Density of Clusters
-Spatial density of volcanoes modeled with Kernel Density Estimation
-Size of volcanic field determined by a set contour (95\%)
-\begin{equation}
\text{Average vent intensity} = \frac{\text{volcanic vents}}{\text{field area}}
-This is applied to fields on Earth, Mars, and Venus

Syria Planum
-Volcanic vents have been cataloged on Syria Planum
-Large volcanic units are ID'd with geomorphology and embaying flow fronts
-Region was active for 900~Ma (3.5-2.6~Ga)
-Center of volcanism changed with time
